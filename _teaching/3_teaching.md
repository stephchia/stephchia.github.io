I am working with my advisor to develop materials for a new course in the Biology Honors Program using generative AI. To help students apply learned concepts to prioritize conservation targets without bias from preexisting knowledge of real species, I created a diverse set of fictional species spanning a wide range of life-history traits, population statuses, and human utitilies.
