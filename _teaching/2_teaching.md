Motivated by my interest in sustainability, I joined the teaching initiative to [integrate global change concepts into the undergraduate biology curriculum](https://biology.umd.edu/news/umd-offers-undergraduate-courses-grand-challenge-global-change) as a TA for Population Ecology, supported by a UMD Teaching and Learning Grant.

I designed and delivered five lectures centered on Blue Crabs (an iconic species for Marylanders), using a case study approach to introduce key concepts in population dynamics, including population structure, species interactions, spatial dynamics, harvesting, and climate change. This includes an [R tutorial](/blog/2024/population-matrix/) as an in-class activity to demonstrate how these concepts can be applied to explore fishery policy options. 

The lectures I developed have been integrated into the regular curriculum, and I was invited back the following year to give guest lectures.
