I taught anatomy lab sections twice a week for four semesters as part of the course (with lectures on physiology taught by the course instructor). To make this memorization-heavy subject more engaging, I incorporated active learning activities and developed online games as study aids. These games became widely used and are now a regular resource for the ~800 students who take the course each year.

During this time, I earned an average student evaluation score of 3.9/4.0 and received the Outstanding Graduate Teaching Assistant Award from the University of Maryland.
