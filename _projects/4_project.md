I participated in two projects investigating corss-species patterns of animal movements, supporting data analysis and visualization.

- **Altitudinal migration of birds**: Using eBird data to characterize seasonal elevational movement of 100+ resident bird species in Taiwan, we found that the majority of species tend to shift elevation across seasons, likely driven by thermal tolerance and food availability. ([paper](https://doi.org/10.1111/ecog.05196))
- **Route navigation of carnivores**: Analyzing GPS tracking data of 1,000+ individuals across 32 species, we found distinct patterns between canids and felids in their spatial strategies in navigating home range. (paper in press)
