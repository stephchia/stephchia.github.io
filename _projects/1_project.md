Why do some seemingly viable life forms not exist? I use [topological data analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_data_analysis) to identify "gaps" in trait space (i.e. regions where species are absent) and ask what processes create and maintain these gaps. By studying what is missing as well as what is present, I aim to uncover the ecological and evolutionary forces that shape the boundaries of biodiversity.

Current and prospective projects under this theme:

- **Macroevolutionary constraints of bird morphology**: We identified a viable body form missing from a large group of songbirds, explained by niche preemption from early-arriving lineages (paper submitted). I am interested in extending this framework to other taxa and trait systems.
- **Community assembly and invasion**: I am interested in identifying gaps in biological communities to investigate assembly processes and invasion risk.
