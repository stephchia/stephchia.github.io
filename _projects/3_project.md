I am interested in using data and quantitative approaches to explore sustainability challenges. My projects, both academic and non-academic, have included:

- **Food system efficiency**: optimizing crop distributions for water savings and yield (ongoing); reducing food waste from foodservice providers by predicting consumption patterns 
- **Energy use and urban cooling**: analyzing demographic effects on household electricity use; evaluating roof coatings as a strategy for urban cooling
- **Sustainable agriculture**: working with organic tea farmers on strategies to reduce weeding labor and predict harvest timing using microclimate monitoring.

These projects, many from earlier stages of my training and experience, illustrate the kinds of topics that motivate me. Moving forward, I aim to continue exploring how quantitative tools can contribute creatively to practical solutions.
