Functional traits are the interface between organisms and their environments. I study how traits reflect ecological functions and selective pressures, with the aim of understanding the mechanisms that shape biodiversity.

Projects under this theme:

- **Ecological function of enclosed nests in birds**: We tested whether enclosed nests primarily serve to reduce predation risk or regulate microclimate across global bird species ([data paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-023-02837-1); [research paper preprint](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5538447/v1))
- **Community assembly of moths along climate gradients**: We used shifts in body size composition along an elevational gradient to understand the roles of environmental filtering and niche partitioning in shaping moth assemblages ([paper](https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.14467))
