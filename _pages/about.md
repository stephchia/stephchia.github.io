Hi! I'm a PhD candidate in Ecology & Evolution at the University of Maryland, working with [Bill Fagan](https://biology.umd.edu/people/william-fagan). Iâ€™m broadly interested in the ecological and evolutionary processes that shape biodiversity, drawing on large datasets of traits, phylogeny, species distributions, and environments.

I grew up in Taiwan and studied biology at National Taiwan University, then earned a Master's in Sustainable Bussiness and Innovation at Utrecht University in the Netherlands. After working in environmental consulting, I discovered my interest in research and joined [Mao-Ning Tuanmu](https://biodiv.tw/pi-Mao-Ning_Tuanmu)'s lab at Academia Sinica, where I began my journey in ecological research.

Outside of research, I enjoy hiking and traveling, and occasionally biking, birding, scuba diving, and photography.

If all goes as planned, I'll be graduating in Spring 2026, and I'd be glad to connect about research opportunities.
